Objective:
Apply data-mining techniques and modern AI tools — Generative AI (GenAI), Large 
Language Models (LLMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs) — to simulate, explore, and 
preprocess financial transaction and investment data. Students will learn to combine 
traditional data-mining workflows with AI-driven insights.
